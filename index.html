			<p>Cats are cute. I like cats. I like cute. You like cats. You like cute. That's why we're here. Welcome to the CUTE CAT CINGDOM funny spelling lololoolol. Together, we shall summon cats in the middle of the night. But this isn't a blog so you can't share any photos unless if I give you guys an email to send photos to. But guess what, I won't because I don't want any viruses :/ Anyways back to the cats. They are some of the loveliest creatures in this world. Manga style is based off of cats. They are the epitome of cuteness.</p>
